/// It is the most modern wallet version at the moment. It still has all the functionality of the previous versions,
/// but also introduces something very powerful â€” plugins.
/// This feature allows developers to implement complex logic that will work in tandem with a
/// user's wallet. For example, some DApp may require a user to pay a small amount of coins every day
/// to use some features, so the user will need to install the plugin on their wallet by signing a transaction.
/// This plugin will send coins to the destination address every day when it will be reqested by an external message.
/// This is a very customizable feature which is unique to TON Blockchain.
