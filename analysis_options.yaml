# This file configures the static analysis results for your project (errors,
# warnings, and lints).
#
# This enables the 'recommended' set of lints from `package:lints`.
# This set helps identify many issues that may lead to problems when running
# or consuming Dart code, and enforces writing Dart using a single, idiomatic
# style and format.
#
# If you want a smaller set of lints you can change this to specify
# 'package:lints/core.yaml'. These are just the most critical lints
# (the recommended set includes the core lints).
# The core lints are also what is used by pub.dev for scoring packages.

# include: package:lints/recommended.yaml
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml
# Uncomment the following section to specify additional rules.
linter:
  rules:
    prefer_final_locals: true        # Warns when a local variable could be final
    prefer_final_in_for_each: true   # Warns when a forEach variable could be final
    prefer_const_constructors: true  # Warns when a constructor could be const
    prefer_const_declarations: true  # Warns when a declaration could be const
